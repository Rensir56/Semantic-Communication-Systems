# Deep-Learning-Enabled-Semantic-Communication-Systems-with-Task-Unaware-Transmitter-and-Dynamic-Data
pytorch implementation of "Deep Learning-Enabled Semantic Communication Systems with Task-Unaware Transmitter and Dynamic Data"

## Prerequites
* [Python 3.7]
* [PyTorch 0.1.12]
* [Torchvision 0.9.1]
* [Torch 1.5.1]
* [Numpy 1.21.2]

## The folders
["semantic_extraction"](./semantic_extraction) and ["semantic_system_with_DA"](./semantic_system_with_DA) are the semantic extraction part and the data adaptation part of the proposed method in the paper.   

The details are represented in the two sub-folders.

## Other Instructions
This is an example of semantic communication using a small-sized dataset based on MLP and CNN.
If you require a more advanced neural network framework, we recommend using [another code repository based on Swin Transformer](https://github.com/SJTU-mxtao/semantic-communication-w-codebook)
